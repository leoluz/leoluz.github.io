Yet another attempt to maintain a blog. :)

# History

In 2008 I created my first blog at Wordpress containing tech general topics posts in my mother tongue (pt_br). I maintained the blog for almost 2 years and I was aways pushing myself to come up with new articles and new ideas. To be honest, it was pretty boring! I was dedicating a lot of my time to it and I wasn't having fun at all. I was enjoying more the activities related with the blog maintenance than with the writing itself.

# Motivation

After reading [this][1] post (tks [@rafaelrosafu][3]) on [akitaonrails][2]'s blog I decided to give it a second try. But my strategy will be a bit different this time. In early 2012 I moved to Canada and here I struggle (still) to communicate in English and French. So, my first goal is to practice and improve my English writing skills.

This blog is hosted on [github][5] and is based on [Jekyll][4] which is way more interesting tool than Wordpress to me.

Other than that, my plan is to write posts related to the technologies and programming languages that I'm using currently. The objective is to serve as a future reference and hopefully helpful to someone else out there as well.

Last but not least, I will not push my self this time. Whenever I find something interesting to write I'll publish it. I'm not a professional blogger and I don't have the intention to become one. The only thing that drives me is my own motivation.

Cheers!
